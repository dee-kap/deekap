    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I have been writing software for both fun and profit for over twenty years, and it’s been a deeply rewarding journey. Coding is more than just a profession for me—it's a passion that has shaped much of my life.</p>
<p>Beyond programming, I enjoy reading, spending quality time with my family on holidays, and experimenting in the kitchen.</p>
<p>According to the 16Personalities test, I’m a <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality">Logician INTP-A</a>. While these personality tests aren’t definitive, I find that the Strengths and Weaknesses section resonates with me the most.</p>
<p>I’m on a lifelong mission to refine my thinking, aiming to be a little less wrong each day.</p>
<h2>About This Website</h2>
<p>This website has been around in various forms (on different domains) since 2003. Initially, it was primarily a technical blog focused on programming. In 2022, I decided to wipe the slate clean, removing old content that no longer reflected my interests or value to others.</p>
<p>When I first started blogging, my goal was to promote myself professionally and gain recognition in tech circles. I achieved desired success in that.</p>
<p>Now, while coding is still a core part of my identity, I’ve developed interests in other areas as well. This website is no longer just a technical blog, it’s a more authentic space that reflects who I am today.</p>
