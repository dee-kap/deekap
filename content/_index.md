ğŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Deepak.

ğŸŒ´ Welcome to my digital space, web cave, garden thingy!

ğŸ’» Iâ€™m a Software Developer from Sydney, Australia ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º

My journey in the world of programming began in the mid-1990s, just as the World Wide Web was starting to weave its global tapestry.

To know more about me, you can visit my About page.

These days Iâ€™m having fun building front-ends in React and back-ends in node.js and Python.
