Summary:

One of the reasons I started this blog back in 2003 was to use it as a marketing tool for myself. Personal branding had started to become a thing and blogging scene was about to take off big time. I was fortunate enough to grab on to it and together with other community activities, it worked out well for me.

Software is still my passion but there are also other interests I pursue. Reading, Cooking, Finance, photography are some of them.

Lately I have been pondering the question of merging my tech and non-tech writings in one place. I am much more than a programmer and those aspects do not get any space online.

A question comes to mind: Why bother writing about them at all? Why not just enjoy non-tech adventures in obscurity? Does the world need to know about them?

First of all, I'm confident that this blog is read only by 2 people. One of them is me and the other I have yet to know about. Secondly, and more importantly <mark>this website exists only to serve me</mark> If anyone else finds anything useful here then it it incidental and not intentional. It is after all a log of my life which will be of no interest to anyone.

With that thought, I decided to make it more complete by writing about the books I have read, the journeys I have been on (there are not too many), photos I have clicked and a lot more.

Also, tinkering with this website gives me the joy similar to working in the garage with tools.

So here it is to a more authentic place which is both about and beyond code. Cheers!
