MacOS on Macbook air with M2 chip.

## Editors

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) Nothing comes close to the power of VIM once you have learned how to exit out of it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1dtmzqnCU" target="_blank">You don't change VIM, VIM changes you
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Everyone is using it so it must be good. Remember that saying about millions of flies?
