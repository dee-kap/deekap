Summary: 



In Ruby on Rails, when dealing with database queries, there are instances where we anticipate a query to return a single record. This expectation arises in scenarios where the uniqueness of a record is integral to the application's logic. However, databases can sometimes contain duplicates or multiple records that meet the query criteria, leading to potential conflicts or unexpected behavior in our application. To ensure robust and error-free application behavior, it's essential to handle these cases effectively.

Consider a scenario where we query the Book model for all its records:

```ruby
irb(main):018> Book.all
  Book Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "books".* FROM "books" /* loading for pp */ LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 11]]
=>
[#<Book:0x000000010e29cbd8
  id: 1,
  title: "Catcher in The Rye",
  price: 0.1599e2,
  created_at: Wed, 17 Jan 2024 09:55:46.668892000 UTC +00:00,
  updated_at: Wed, 17 Jan 2024 10:09:26.612252000 UTC +00:00,
  published_date: nil>,
 #<Book:0x000000010e29ca98
  id: 2,
  title: "Dracula",
  price: 0.2299e2,
  created_at: Wed, 17 Jan 2024 10:30:08.507102000 UTC +00:00,
  updated_at: Wed, 17 Jan 2024 10:30:08.507102000 UTC +00:00,
  published_date: nil>,
 #<Book:0x000000010e29c958
  id: 3,
  title: "Catcher in The Rye",
  price: 0.2299e2,
  created_at: Mon, 05 Feb 2024 07:27:12.511819000 UTC +00:00,
  updated_at: Mon, 05 Feb 2024 07:27:12.511819000 UTC +00:00,
  published_date: nil>]
irb(main):019>
```

In this example, we retrieve multiple Book records. While this direct fetch is straightforward for multiple records, complications arise when our logic expects only a single record in return.

### The Challenge of Ensuring Uniqueness

Suppose we want to fetch a book by its title, expecting that title to be unique. However, if our database has multiple entries for the same title, this assumption breaks, and our application might behave unpredictably.

To tackle this, we could write a method like get_book:

```ruby
def get_book(title)
    books = Book.where(title: title)
    raise ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique if books.many?

    return books.first
end
```

This method fetches all books matching the given title and raises an exception if more than one record is found, effectively enforcing our uniqueness constraint. Here's how it behaves:

```ruby
irb(main):040> get_book("Catcher in The Rye")
  Book Count (0.4ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT 1 AS one FROM "books" WHERE "books"."title" = ? LIMIT ?) subquery_for_count  [["title", "Catcher in The Rye"], ["LIMIT", 2]]
(irb):35:in `get_book': ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique (ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique)
irb(main):041>
```

### A More Elegant Solution with .sole

While the above method works, Rails offers a cleaner, more idiomatic way to achieve the same result with the .sole method. This method is designed to return a single record and automatically raises an ActiveRecord::SoleRecordExceeded exception if more than one record matches the query, simplifying our approach:

The get_book method can be shortened to this

```ruby
def get_book(title)
    Book.where(title: title).sole
end
```

```ruby
irb(main):045> get_book("Catcher in The Rye")
  Book Load (0.4ms)  SELECT "books".* FROM "books" WHERE "books"."title" = ? ORDER BY "books"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["title", "Catcher in The Rye"], ["LIMIT", 2]]
/Users/deepak/.rbenv/versions/3.2.2/lib/ruby/gems/3.2.0/gems/activerecord-7.1.3/lib/active_record/relation/finder_methods.rb:141:in `sole': Wanted only one Book (ActiveRecord::SoleRecordExceeded)
```

This approach is not only cleaner but also more efficient, as it communicates our intent more clearly and leverages Rails' built-in mechanisms for enforcing record uniqueness.
