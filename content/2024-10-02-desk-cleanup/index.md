Summary: Improving my working environment by cleaning my desk

Few days ago I bought a monitor stand which came in today. It is a Meatanty Dual Monitor Stand Riser with 2 Drawers, 4 Usb Ports and Charging Pad. Recently I made some ergonomic changes to my working environment like changing to a vertical mouse. Although I do not have RSI yet, but sometimes I feel a little bit of pain in my wrist. Before it gets any worse, I have started making some changes to my environment.

Getting a monitor stand is part of these ergonomic changes. I noticed that I bend my neck slightly to look at the screen. This may not be the best in long term and with the stand, I see the monitor at my natural eye level.

As I was setting up the stand, I decided to embark on the quest of cleaning my desk which was slowly turning into a museum of all sorts of useless things. Nothing too revolutionary, just removing the clutter which unnecessarily occupied space and added zero value. At the end I'm proud of my achievement. Here is the obligatory photo of what it looks like as I'm writing this post.

Now let's get real. Soon I will have a bunch of other things (clutter) which will occupy most of the zen like space I have now. But, I will try to keep it like this or at least get into a routine of cleaning it up once a week. Until then, I'll enjoy the serenity in my room.
