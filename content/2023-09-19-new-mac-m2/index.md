Summary: 



Apple has a good trade-in facility and few weeks ago they were offering $825 for my old Mac which was M1 with 16gb memory. I took the deal and got myself a new machine.

As someone who spends a good part of the day working on a computer, I'm enjoying the speed and asthetics of the new M2.
