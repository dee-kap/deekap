Every now and then I like many others find myself stuck with problems to which there seems no solution. Over the years, I have created a way I solve this problem. It is simple but effective.

Here are the steps I take

1. I start by writing a message or an email to a team member. If I'm working on a project all by myself then I write it to be posted on a forum. The important thing here is that I assume that I cannot have any other form of contact with the recipient.

In this message, I try to describe the problem in as much detail as possible. I also include the steps I ahve taken to solve it.

2. And that's it, by the time I'm done writing this message, I have figured out the solution.

Why does this work?

I did not give much attention to writing until I read this from Fynman. This is where thinking happens.

To me it seems that the act of writing it in details, somehow triggers whatchamacallit in my brain and the solution emerges.

I have also started applying this writing technique to other areas of life.

Write iT down

Be clear and precise

Each step

This also increases knowledge
