When I started this blog, I wrote a [post](/few-thoughts-on-blogging/) in which I mentioned about my past blogging adventures. While browsing through those files, I realized that I started blogging in 2005. At that time I was involved with WinFX which eventually became Microsoft .NET 3.0.

I also realized that although it may not be of any use to either me or anyone else, it is still a record of my forays into different technologies and I should preserve it.

Today, I am starting a side project which is to restore all my posts from the past.

Every restored post will be marked with a blurb on top to indicate the staleness of the content.

I look at it as a fun project where the only gain is personal satisfaction.
