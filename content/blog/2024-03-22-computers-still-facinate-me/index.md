I have been working working with computers for more than 25 years now and they still fascinate me.

Today I started a personal project to create a digital catalog of my books. It is not an easy task because I have somewhere around a thousand books in my library. Creating a list manually will be too difficult and most likely ripe for abandonment.

Enter computers and it is both a breeze and damn interesting.

This is how I'm going about it.

1. Use the amazing My Library app to scan each book. It will use the ISBN number to search for the book and add it to a list.
2. Export the list to my Google Drive.
3. Write a simple script to read the exported list and convert it to a format I can use for this blog.
4. Enjoy the [result](/library)

The ease by which I can accomplish this task is just mind blowing to me.

Also the fun factor of doing such things is too hard to say no to.
