In October 2020 I got myself a monitor which I'd been eyeing for a while. A 43 inch monstrosity I ordered from Amazon.

I remember the day it arrived and how my excitement raced to null as soon as I placed it on my desk. My first thought was that I had made a mistake by ordering this massive monitor and there was no way I could use it. I decided to use it for about half an hour just to see the 4K glory and then I will pack it up and return it for a refund.

I connected my Macbook and started working. In about half an hour it was lunch time so I went to the kitchen to grab a bite. I came back and got into some more work. I thought that I will pack the monitor at the end of the day.

Towards afternoon, I had a feeling as if I have always had that monitor and the secondary thought was that how did I ever live without it. Within few hours I was hooked and kept the monitor. I have been using it for almost four years.

Few days ago, I started thinking about getting another mostrosity. This time, a 49 inch curved screen which I saw on display at a local electronics store.
