Title: Colophon
Date: 2024-10-10

This site is built with [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) and hosted on Github.

The theme is inspired by [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/). I have sprinkled some CSS and other spices to make it look the way I like.

The background color in dark mode is from [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) Palette.

Tinkering with this website gives me a therapeutic feeling: the kind one would get by working with tools in a garage.
