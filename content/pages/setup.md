These are some of the tools I use daily for my work and recreational computing.

## Operating System and hardware

MacOS on Macbook air with M2 chip.

## Editors

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) Nothing comes close to the power of VIM once you have learned how to exit out of it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1dtmzqnCU" target="_blank">You don't change VIM, VIM changes you
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Everyone is using it so it must be good. Remember that saying about millions of flies?

## Shell

- [Z shell](https://www.zsh.org/) with [Oh my Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and a bunch of useful plugins. Oh my!

## Terminal

- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) Fast and furious
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) Scrolling is better

## Multiplexer

- [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/) I thought I'll be hooked on Tmux like forever

## Colorscheme

- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) everywhere (mostly)
- [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) when I fantasize about travelling to Norway
