Iâ€™m on a lifelong journey of progressively trying to be less wrong.

I write software for fun and profit. I have been doing this for more than twenty years and it has been a wonderful journey.

Other than programming, my interests are reading books, holidaying with my family and cooking.

According to 16personalities, my personality type is [Logician INTP-A](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality)

Take what you will from this. All I can say is that it is not completely wrong. Strengths and Weaknesses are of particular interest.
