Summary: Moving this blog from Hugo to Zola
Draft: true


This blog up until now was creating using Hugo which worked well until now.

Since last few days I noticed that the Hugo process was taking up much more CPU. This did not sit well with me. Why should a static site generator be one of the top items for CPU usage.

I decided that it was time for me to retire Hugo and move to Zola which is written in Rust and is super fast and highly efficient. Lately I have been using a bunch of tools written in Rust such as eza, zoxide, bat and few more. I decided that Zola fits in perfectly with my preference for tools written in Rust.

So from now on, this site is generated using Zola. Check it out, it is cool.
