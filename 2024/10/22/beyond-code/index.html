      <article class="h-entry">
        <p>One of the reasons I started this blog back in 2003 was to use it as a marketing tool for myself. Personal branding had started to become a thing and blogging scene was about to take off big time. I was fortunate enough to grab on to it and together with other community activities, it worked out well for me.</p>
<p>Software is still my passion but there are also other interests I pursue. Reading, Cooking, Finance, photography are some of them.</p>
<p>Lately I have been pondering the question of merging my tech and non-tech writings in one place. I am much more than a programmer and those aspects do not get any space online.</p>
<p>A question comes to mind: Why bother writing about them at all? Why not just enjoy non-tech adventures in obscurity? Does the world need to know about them?</p>
<p>First of all, I'm confident that this blog is read only by 2 people. One of them is me and the other I have yet to know about. Secondly, and more importantly <mark>this website exists only to serve me</mark> If anyone else finds anything useful here then it it incidental and not intentional. It is after all a log of my life which will be of no interest to anyone.</p>
<p>With that thought, I decided to make it more complete by writing about the books I have read, the journeys I have been on (there are not too many), photos I have clicked and a lot more.</p>
<p>Also, tinkering with this website gives me the joy similar to working in the garage with tools.</p>
<p>So here it is to a more authentic place which is both about and beyond code. Cheers!</p>
